# Study Timer App

Created using Flutter and Firebase for storage.

This app is to help a user stick to the study technique of 45 minutes of studying then 15 minutes of break by timing the different sections. The app detects if the phone moves while studying and alerts the user that they broke their study time by going on their phone.

This app also helps a user detect how long they sleep for using a timer that stops when it detects the phone moving.

It also stores and presents statistics about the users average study and sleep times to help the user improve upon these aspects.
